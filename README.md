# cookie-stand

This is the README for the cookie stand projects. This contains the base html for a public facing index page with store info, as well as a private sales page to display sample data about the cookie stands. The private page can not only display current store information with the .render method on a store object, but can add new stores using the harvestAndPost function. This takes in store data inserted into the form and appends a new store to the table.
