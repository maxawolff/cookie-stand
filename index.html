     <h3>What is Salmon Cookies?</h3>
     <p>
       Salmon Cookies are the hottest new trend sweeping the Seattle area. Not only are our delicious Salmon Cookies shaped like the classic northwest fish, they're actually made for salmon too. While this may seem crazy to you, Salmon Cookies are actually quite tasty. We start with the freshest Salmon that we could find laying outside the local market and grind it down into a fine powder. Then that powder is added to our fantastic store bought cookie dough and baked for 5 minutes, just enough to give it that rare fish flavor that we all love. Salmon cookies are available in the folowing tasty flavors.
       <ul>
         <li> Coho Chocolate Chip</li>
         <li> Sockeye Sugar Cookie</li>
         <li> Chinook Oatmeal Rasin</li>
       </ul>
       Please stop by and see what that fishy smell is ... its cookies!
